### Mini Briefs

#### [The messy, secretive reality behind OpenAI's bid to save the world](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615181/ai-openai-moonshot-elon-musk-sam-altman-greg-brockman-messy-secretive-reality/)

This detailed profile of OpenAI offers a glimpse of the inner workings of the famous AI research startup.
OpenAI's achievements and recent PR struggles come from a tricky balance of 3 things: pursuing Artificial General Intelligence, a goal the AI research community considers ill-defined and far-fetched, obtaining enough funding to do increasingly larger experiments (more compute and data), and guarding research results which helps OpenAI maintain an edge but runs counter to its supposed openness:

> There is a misalignment between what the company publicly espouses and how it operates behind closed doors. Over time, it has allowed a fierce competitiveness and mounting pressure for ever more funding to erode its founding ideals of transparency, openness, and collaboration.

#### [If You Drive in Los Angeles, Police Can Track Your Every Move](https://www.wired.com/story/drive-los-angeles-police-track-every-move/)

While Automated Licsense Plate Reading (ALPR) technology has been around for awhile, recent advances in machine learning has enabled ALPR to be more powerful and deployed at a much larger scale.
For example, LAPD queried Palantir's ALPR system more than 300 times per day back in 2016.
In addition to searching the whereabouts of a particular license plate, police officers can also search for all license plates that appeared in an area during a time frame, and search with visual descriptions of a vehicle, like "white Ford pickup".

Because of the power of ALPR systems and the lack of regulations, civil liberty groups are concerned about its potential for abuse:

> "The broad language for categorizing searches suggests that no indication of criminality is required to make a query," says the ACLU’s Bibring. "If that’s the case, it’s basically the Wild West for when officers can query millions of data points."
