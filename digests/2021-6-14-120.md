### Mini Briefs

#### [AI still sucks at moderating hate speech](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/04/1025742/ai-hate-speech-moderation/)

Incendiary speech is one of the most persistent issues plaguing social media platforms. Given how easily information can spread through social networks and the fact that controversial speech often invites strong reactions, hate speech finds itself at the center of discussions on moderating social media content. Platforms like Facebook have tapped into language AI technology to rise to the challenge, but that technology still struggles: a recent study found that four of the best AI-based hate speech detectors struggled in different ways to distinguish toxic and innocuous sentences. While the study's results cast doubt on the efficacy of hate speech detection systems, the researchers were able to create a taxonomy of different types of hate speech and evaluate how the AI systems fell short at a more granular level. This alone represents useful progress and should help researchers better diagnose and improve hate speech detection systems.

#### [Google is using AI to design its next generation of AI chips more quickly than humans can](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527476/google-machine-learning-chip-design-tpu-floorplanning)

As machine learning models become larger and, as a result, compute costs for those models increase, the industry has turned its attention to developing more efficient AI models. This involves creating models that themselves require less compute to train and developing underlying hardware that can more quickly perform the computations that power deep learning models. In a meta-twist, Google has decided to use machine learning to design its own machine learning chips, and its engineers claim that the algorithm's designs are "comparable or superior" to those created by humans and that the algorithm completes its designs far more quickly than humans can. While Google has been working on using machine learning to create chips for years, this effort, described in a paper in _Nature_, is the first to be applied to a commercial product: Google's TPU chips.
