### Mini Briefs

#### [This Small Company Is Turning Utah Into a Surveillance Panopticon](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/k7exem/banjo-ai-company-utah-surveillance-panopticon)

Banjo, a startup based in Utah, has set its ambitions on using machine learning and real-time data to help police solve crimes and tackle the opiod crises.
Last year, the company struck a deal with the state of Utah that allowed it direct to access the state's "thousands of traffice cameras" and "911 systems."

To counter the obvious privacy concerns with its data access, Banjo often touts its patented privacy-preserving machine learning technology that can, among other things, "find crime without identifying criminals."
However, no details about how this is exactly accomplished has been released, and there is the serious question of whether the benefits of predictive policing outweigh its costs:

> What is unclear is how many lives Banjo has saved, if it has saved any, and whether it's even possible to create a product that automatically detects crime without creating a creeping surveillance state that inherently infringes on people's rights and invades their privacy.

### Advances & Business

Now Facebook is revealing details on how it uses AI to fight back.

* [YouTube has nearly halved the number of conspiracy theory videos it recommends](https://www.technologyreview.com/f/615308/youtube-halved-conspiracy-theory-videos-recommends/) - The news: YouTube has managed to drastically reduce the number of conspiracy theory videos it recommends, but the total is creeping back up again, according to a new study.

* [This Is The Year Of AI Regulations](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2020/03/01/this-is-the-year-of-ai-regulations/) - The world of artificial intelligence is constantly evolving, and certainly so is the legal and regulatory environment in which it exists.

* [How TensorFlow AI is helping preserve Japanese culture](https://about.google/intl/ALL_in/stories/tensorflow-ai-japanese-culture/) - Old scripts become extinct when they're no longer known or read, like the ancient Japanese script Kuzushiji.
