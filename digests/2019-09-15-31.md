### Mini Briefs

#### [White House Summit on AI in Government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Summary-of-White-House-Summit-on-AI-in-Government-September-2019.pdf)

The White House recently hosted a summit on current and future applications of AI in government. 
It highlighted 3 current use cases of AI in different federal agencies - detecting and tracking wildfires with the Department of Defense, automate indexing and improve search for medical citations with the Natinoal Institute of Health, and discover redundant, outdated regulations with the Department of Health and Services. 

While the summit didn't produce concrete new AI initiatives, it is still a sign that the U.S. government is paying more attention to the potential benefits of AI in its operations.
The report highlights the need to train more workers with knowledge of AI and AI tools in the federal government, which may stem further collaborations in worker upskilling between the government and industry.

#### [AI Can Pass Standardized Tests—But It Would Fail Preschool](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-can-pass-standardized-testsbut-it-would-fail-preschool/)

Resesarchers at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence built a language model that is capable of scoring 90% on the eigth-grade New York State Regents Exam in science, consisting of fill-in-the-blank multiple-choice questions.

While impressive,
> The truth is that while these systems perform well on specific language-processing tests, they can only take the test. None come anywhere close to matching humans in reading comprehension or other general abilities that the test was designed to measure.

Crucially, a language model is not trained to specifically reason about anything.
It is trained to predict the next word given the previous words in a sentence or paragraph.

As such, answering many of these multiple-choice questions may not require as much comprehension and reasoning ability as one might imagine.
Many times the answer tend to be the option that has the highest probability of appearing next to the words in the question, which can be easily obtained for a model trained on a large enough corpus of sentences.

Making an AI system that comprehends and reasons about these questions will probably require "common sense" knowledge not explicitly encoded in any dataset.
As the author of the article puts it:
> Rather than being ready for high school or college, AI has a lot of growing to do before it’s even ready for preschool.


### Advances & Business

Through the use of AI, scientists can design, synthesize, and validate a new drug in 46 days. The scientists hope this new method will speed up the process of drug development. Not only that, they aim to use it for work on aging research.

* [Who does AI think you are? This groundbreaking new exhibit will show you](https://www.fastcompany.com/90400613/who-does-ai-think-you-are-this-groundbreaking-new-exhibit-will-show-you) - A new exhibition in Milan analyzes the troubling history of machine learning data sets—and lets both in-person and remote visitors see how AI classifies them.

Often, these plans are formed as natural language sentences. This approach enables us to achieve our goal and also adapt to new challenges, because we can leverage elements of previous plans to tackle new tasks, rather than starting from scratch each time.

* [Exclusive Interview: Why Facebook Is Training Robots To Think](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2019/09/03/exclusive-interview-why-facebook-is-training-robots-to-think/) - On the rooftop of the building that houses the Facebook AI Research (FAIR) lab in Mountain View, California, there is a bootcamp for robots where the sun beams down on Daisy, a hexapod who is learning how to walk on a dirt jogging path.

### Concerns & Hype

* [Six questions to ask yourself when reading about AI](https://qz.com/1706248/six-questions-to-ask-yourself-when-reading-about-ai/) - Hardly a week goes by without some breathless bit of AI news touting a “major” new discovery or warning us we are about to lose our jobs to the newest breed of smart machines. Rest easy. As two scientists who have spent our careers studying AI, we can tell you that a large fraction of what’s reported is overhyped.

* [Superhuman AI Bots Pose a Threat to Online Poker Firms, Morgan Stanley Says](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-12/superhuman-ai-bots-pose-a-threat-to-online-poker-firms-ms-says) - The threat for online poker players is not the human desktop card sharks playing against you, but the superhuman artificial intelligence bots that could infiltrate games, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley. 

* [Robots Won't Take Away All Our Jobs, MIT Report Finds](https://www.wbur.org/bostonomix/2019/09/10/mit-future-of-work-report) - The robots are coming, but not necessarily for your job.
