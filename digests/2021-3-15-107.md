### Mini Briefs

#### [Clearview AI sued in California by immigrant rights groups, activists](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/09/tech/clearview-ai-mijente-lawsuit/index.html)

The controversial facial recognition provider Clearview AI is being sued in California by two immigrants' rights groups to prevent its technology from spreading throughout the state. The complaint alleges that the company's software is still used by law enforcement to identify individuals, defying bans in several California cities. The suit also alleges that the company's database violates privacy rights and that its surveillance technology disproportionately affects immigrants and communities of color. This adds to Clearview's docket a continuing lawsuit filed by the ACLU last year, which alleged that Clearview had violated Illinois' 2008 Biometric Information Privacy Act.

#### [How Facebook got addicted to spreading misinformation](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/11/1020600/facebook-responsible-ai-misinformation/)

Facebook has, in the last few years, suffered a precipitous drop in public perception due to the social consequences of its platform. In particular, its recommendation algorithm has received intense scrutiny for its role in spreading misinformation and stoking political divides. While Facebook has made public statements to the effect that it will examine its algorithms more carefully and did make an effort to reduce the spread of false information leading up to the 2020 election, these efforts do not appear to reflect a long-term commitment. In a frustrating conversation with a director of AI at Facebook, Joaquin Quiñonero Candela, Karen Hao found that Facebook's responsible AI efforts were largely focused on AI bias, and Quiñonero and his colleagues refused to even discuss the issues of misinformation more deeply. She attributes this de-prioritization of Facebook's most important issue to Mark Zuckerberg's desire for growth.
