### Mini Briefs

#### [The age of killer robots may have already begun](https://www.axios.com/age-killer-robots-begun-8e8813d9-0fa1-4529-baf9-3358c1703bee.html)

A recent U.N. report states that an autonomous drone may have been used to attack soldiers in the conflict in Libya last year.
while drones have been used as a weapon for a long time, which target they engage with and whether or not they fire a weapon has always been controlled by humans.
If verified, this seems to be the first time that an algorithm running on the drone has autonomously identified targets and launched attacks without human control.
There is real danger in the proliferation of such autonomous drones, and many countries, including the U.S., have refused to agree to a global ban on lethal autonomous weapons.

#### [King County is first in the country to ban facial recognition software](https://komonews.com/news/local/king-county-is-first-in-the-country-to-ban-facial-recognition-software)

The county recently approved a ban on government use of facial recognition software, addressing many's concerns with the system's impact on privcay, bias, and harm, especially when used by law enforcement.
There have been a growing backslash toward facial recognition software in the last year and a half, and bans like this will likely continue.
No government agency in King County, including police departments, have used facial recognition software before the ban.
The does not impact use of facial recognition by companies and private citizens.
