### Mini Briefs

#### ["AI for Good" talk pushes tech usage to mitigate humans' environmental impact](https://www.stanforddaily.com/2020/01/27/ai-for-good-talk-pushes-tech-usage-to-mitigate-humans-environmental-impact/)

The third installment of Stanford's "AI for Good" seminar series discussed leveraging AI and machine learning to mitigate humans' environmental impact. 
Stanford assistant computer science professor Stefano Ermon highlighted recent progress in AI research and pointed out that we need to not only consider how to use AI to benefit as many people as possible, but also have representative data and models that provide insight into issues like infrastructure quality, food insecurity, and poverty.

Lucas Joppa, Microsoft's chief environmental officer, discussed the importance of developing technology to maximize humans' benefits on Earth's systems. Joppa's recent memo, "AI for Earth", made recommendations about how Microsoft should deploy its technology after investing in AI research. 
Joppa also created a team within Microsoft focused on answering this question. 
Ermon and Joppa, in response to questions about furthering the application of AI to environmental protection, both stressed the need for gathering more data about the earth and our impact on it.

#### [Why asking an AI to explain itself can make things worse](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615110/why-asking-an-ai-to-explain-itself-can-make-things-worse/)

Deep learning models have seen a lot of successes in recent years, but how they come about their predictions is largely unknown.
This is a problem when such models are used to make decision that impact people's lives, such as in law enforcement and medical diagnosis.
User should be able to understand how predictions are made and have enough information to disagree or rejected automated decision making.

However, recent research into using visualizations to understand a deep learning model its underlying data revealed some striking problems.
While tools sometimes helped people spot missing values in data, this usefulness was overshadowed by a tendency to over-trust and misread the visualizations, and in some cases users couldn't even describe what the visualizations were showing.
An online survey of about 200 machine learning professionals found similar confusion and misplaced confidence. Even
 worse, many participants, despite not understanding the math behind the models, were happy to use the visualizations to make decisions about deploying the models.

Explainable AI researchers today agree that if AI systems are to be used by more people, those people need to be part of the design from the start. 
In addition, the explanations that AI gives need to be understandable by anyone using it. 
Previously, the explainable AI movement was dominated by machine learning researchers. 
Hopefully, with more perspectives from different areas and a human-centered approach, explainable AI can mitigate overconfidence and misplaced trust in AI.

### Advances & Business

* [If a novel was good, would you care if it was created by artificial intelligence?](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/27/artificial-intelligence-computer-novels-fiction-write-books) - Roland Barthes was speaking metaphorically when he suggested in 1967 that "the birth of the reader must be ransomed by the death of the author". But as artificial intelligence takes its first steps in fiction writing, it seems technology may one day start to make Barthes’ metaphor all too real.

* [Artificial Intelligence Will Do What We Ask. That's a Problem.](https://www.quantamagazine.org/artificial-intelligence-will-do-what-we-ask-thats-a-problem-20200130/) - The danger of having artificially intelligent machines do our bidding is that we might not be careful enough about what we wish for. The lines of code that animate these machines will inevitably lack nuance, forget to spell out caveats, and end up giving AI systems goals and incentives that don’t align with our true preferences.

* [YouTube's algorithm seems to be funneling people to alt-right videos](https://www.technologyreview.com/f/615114/a-study-of-youtube-comments-shows-how-its-turning-people-onto-the-alt-right/) - How do we know that?
