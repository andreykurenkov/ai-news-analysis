### Mini Briefs

#### [Robotics, AI, and Cloud Computing Combine to Supercharge Chemical and Drug Synthesis](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/biomedical/devices/robotics-ai-and-cloud-computing-combine-to-supercharge-chemical-and-drug-synthesis)

IBM recently demoed a complex system for chemical testing and drug synthesis.
The system has an AI component that predicts the results of chemical reactions, and a fully automated robotic experiment setup that runs chemical tests 24/7.
Users can access the remote robotics lab online, and IBM can also install the system on-premise.
With these tools working together, IBM is hoping to reduce typical drug discovery and verification time by half.

#### [AI researchers use heartbeat detection to identify deepfake videos](https://venturebeat.com/2020/09/03/ai-researchers-use-heartbeat-detection-to-identify-deepfake-videos/)

Researchers from multiple groups are tackling the challenge of detecting deepfake videos by analyzing the apparent heartbeat of the people depicted in the video.
This is possible, because a person's blood flow changes their skin color ever so slightly, and this change is often detectable via a process called photoplethysmography (PPG).
Because deepfakes are not currently optimizing to generate realisitic heartbeats, temporal or spatial anomalies in PPG signals allow resesarchers to detect deepfakes with a 97% accuracy.
