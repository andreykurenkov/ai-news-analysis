### Mini Briefs

#### [Facebook's AI for detecting hate speech is facing its biggest challenge yet](https://www.fastcompany.com/90539275/facebooks-ai-for-detecting-hate-speech-is-facing-its-biggest-challenge-yet)
Facebook has made significant progress recently to proactively take down content that violate its community standards.
For example, in the second quarter of 2020, Facebook took down 104.6 million pieces of content.
While reviews are typically performed by a vast workforce of human moderators, AI-powered tools have enabled Facebook to do this work at a greater scale for textual content.

However, there's a long way to go for these systems to match or exceed the capabilities of human moderators.
This is because a large proportion of hate speech and misinformation is in the form of images and memes, and reasoning about the context and language-image interplay is an extremely difficult challenge for AI.

> Given Facebook's scale and the speed at which some use it to spread hate, incite violence, and share lies with millions, Facebook will have to keep running to catch up.

#### [AI Slays Top F-16 Pilot In DARPA Dogfight Simulation](https://breakingdefense.com/2020/08/ai-slays-top-f-16-pilot-in-darpa-dogfight-simulation/)

The Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) recently hosted a simulated F16 dogfight competition, with different AI bots competing with each other as well as with human pilots.
The top AI bot was able to beat a human pilot 5-0 in the simulated contest.
DARPA started this program "as a risk-reduction effort \[...\] to flesh out how human and machine pilots share operational control of a fighter jet to maximize its chances of mission success."
Competition runners are broadly optimistic about the demonstration of AI capabilities, even if they are not close to being deployed on a real aircraft.
Of concern, the program had little discussion on the ethics of AI military applications, especially with the lethal autonomous weapon systems being considered.

Thousands of schools nationwide will not be reopening this fall.

* [NYPD Used Facial Recognition Technology In Siege Of Black Lives Matter Activist's Apartment](https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-used-facial-recognition-unit-in-siege-of-black-lives-matter-activists-apartment?amp=1) - The NYPD deployed facial recognition technology in its hunt for a prominent Black Lives Matter activist, whose home was besieged by dozens of officers and police dogs last week, a spokesperson confirmed to Gothamist.

In reality, a greater push toward automation will probably both kill and create jobs - human workers will become redundant in certain spheres, sure, but many new roles will likely crop up.

#### Expert Opinions & Discussion within the field

* [Too many AI researchers think real-world problems are not relevant](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/18/1007196/ai-research-machine-learning-applications-problems-opinion/#Echobox=1597721504) - The community's hyperfocus on novel methods ignores what's really important.
