#### [How to stop AI from recognizing your face in selfies](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/05/05/1024613/stop-ai-recognizing-your-face-selfies-machine-learning-facial-recognition-clearview/)

Concerns over privacy and security have been growing around the prevalence of commercial facial recognition systems.
Researchers have developed new tools to combat the use of such systems, which are often trained on data of people's faces without their consent.
Two recent approaches are detailed in this article.
One is similar to existing adversarial attacks, where pixel-level perturbations are added to images such that a trained facial recognition model can no longer recognize the faces in the image.
Another is a new technique that changes images in such a way that tricks a model to think it's making no errors at training time, so it doesn't learn anything about the altered image.
While these methods are working now against commercial facial recognition services, like Amazon's Rekognition, researchers concede that the field is a "cat-and-mouse arms race," and more robust facial recognition technology will be developed in the future that would require new tools to counter.

#### [Why hasn't Waymo expanded its driverless service? Here's my theory](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/05/why-hasnt-waymo-expanded-its-driverless-service-heres-my-theory/)

Waymo launched its driverless taxi service in Pheonix, Arizona last October, but it has not expanded its service since then.
This article speculates on two of the potential reasons.
The first one is cost - maintaining a fleet of vehciles, supporting operational staff that can remote tele-operate vehicles, and having roadside assistance vans that follow self-driving cars around might be expensive to scale.
However, one could easily make the argument that scaling would actually drive the cost down.
Expensive hardware production (building self-driving cars) typically exhibit economies of scale.
And, if there were more Waymo cars on the road, one roadside assistance van could be in charge of an entire area, instead of following individual cars around.

The second and more convincing reason might be the demand for taxi services is just too low in the suburbs where car ownership is almost a necessity.
Demand is higher in dense, crowded cities, but these profitable areas for taxis are also the most challenge for self-driving cars.
This might in part explain why other self-driving car companies, like Cruise, have prioritized testing in cities like San Francisco since day one, and why Waymo seems to have recently shifted their attention to city driving as well.
