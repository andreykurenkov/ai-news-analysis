### Mini Briefs

#### [DeepMind's Losses and the Future of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.wired.com/story/deepminds-losses-future-artificial-intelligence/)

It's not fresh news that Deepmind had an expensive 2018. Gary Marcus, in an Opinion piece for the Wired, looks at what it means, for Deepmind and AI in general. 

He looks at three central questions: 
>Is DeepMind on the right track scientifically? Are investments of this magnitude sound from Alphabet’s perspective? And how will the losses affect AI in general?
