### Mini Briefs

#### [This avocado armchair could be the future of AI](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/05/1015754/avocado-armchair-future-ai-openai-deep-learning-nlp-gpt3-computer-vision-common-sense/)

OpenAI showcased a new AI system, [DALL'E](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/), that is able to generate images from image captions.
The system is a smaller version of GPT-3 but trained on image caption data - the input is a paragraph describing the image, and the output are a low-res version of the target image that is then upsampled with another neural network.
What's novel about this system is its ability to generate images of combinations of concepts that were not seen in the training data.
For example, a drawing prompt of "an avocado chair" generates chairs plausibly shaped like avocados, with the pit as a seat cushion.
Similar creative generations can be seen with wilder prompts like "a baby daikon radish in a tutu walking a dog" and "a snail made of harp."
While experts caution to take these results with a grain of salt, since details of the system have not been released via a research paper, the results are impressive nonetheless and point to exciting progress in the world of AI generative models.

#### [Why we must democratize AI to invest in human prosperity, with Frank Pasquale](https://pando.com/2021/01/05/why-we-must-democratize-AI-invest-human-prosperity-with-Frank-Pasquale/)

In an interview, Frank Pasquale, Professor of Law at Brooklyn Law School, proposes and elaborates on what he thinks ought to be the new "laws" for autonomous robots and AI.
While many sci-fi enthusiasts may be familiar with Isaac Asimov's three laws of robots, these laws assume that "the development of robots that are indistinguishable from persons" and "try to make sure those robots canâ€™t hurt anyone or hurt them too badly."
However, it is clear now that autonomous robots that are being deployed now and in the near future are quite different from humans, so they require a different treatment.

Professor Pasquale's four laws are:

> First, robotic systems and AI should complement professionals, not replace them. Second, they should not counterfeit humanity. Third, they should not intensify zero-sum arms races. And fourth, they must always indicate the identity of their creators, controllers, and owners.
