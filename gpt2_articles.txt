TITLE= Amazon to Retrain a Third of Its U.S. Workers as Automation Advances TEXT= So far, the American workforce has been largely in workers of color. But Amazon is about to ramp up hiring of some of its more 200,000 hourly workers, according to a person familiar with the company’s plans. The new hires won’t be those in the same field as its more self-professed “white-collar workers,” as the company abbreviates its growing staff. Instead, the roughly 1,000 new workers will be drawn from two large and multiracial groups: Amazon has laid off thousands of Black and Latinx workers, has laid off dozens of Latinx employees, and is currently seeking Federal Employment Development money to pay for new workers.“Right now, the numbers of Black, Latinx, and African American workers are shrinking, because there’s still not enough talent available to continue these high-volume, high-pressure work,” the person familiar with Amazon’s plans explained. Amazon declined to comment on the more than 1,000 new positions it plans to employ.Many of those workers are middle-class white men who choose to build their careers on

TITLE= AI researchers propose making chatbots and voice assistants more like their real-world peers TEXT= Chatbots, which are a form of virtual personas, have long been the interface between human and machine. Advances in the past few years have democratized voice assistants, responding to the needs of multiple speakers at once, aiming to reduce set times and improve duration. But much of the field has proven difficult to apply conversational AI effectively in the real world, especially on sensitive tasks involving such as sales or customer service.To address this issue, a team from MIT Technology Review (MIT Tech Review) and Beijing-based research institute Beijing Brain Institute have developed a novel approach to training conversational AI systems on a dataset of short conversations over long periods of time. The researchers developed a chatbot named QUEBO after their lab name, which stands for QUEBO, "Quō-" or "QUE-BO." They say the research will serve as a benchmark to benchmark conversational AI’s capability to handle small conveniences like social media conversations in real time

TITLE= A fight for the soul of machine learning TEXT= Earlier this month, researchers at Nvidia, one of the biggest artificial intelligence (AI) companies, revealed an unwieldy and potentially game-changing deep learning algorithm called "neural pre-training." In essence, it was so pretrained that it learned far better by trial and error than a human who had been explicitly trained on the same data set.The results promised an entirely new way to train AI. In doing so, it essentially taught itself to do things no robots had ever seen.The result, known as a neural pre-training neural network, or neural network ensembles, has become a favorite of machine learning researchers for its incredible abilities to make breakthroughs in just a few hours. The concept is surprising not only for its potential power and promise, but also because it represents a major paradigm shift in computing. From manually designing and training data sets to finding optimal solutions to streamlining AI projects, pre-training has given rise to a cottage industry dominated by startups and big companies intent on streamlining and streamlining their AI projects.The promise of this new technique, called "deep learning on steroids," originated at Google and proves highly effective at increasing performance across a range of machine learning

But not all scuttling efforts will be on schedule — the nation’s first Spacemaker, which is being constructed in Cape Canaveral beach near Florida.The machine is the brainchild of former Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who is best known for his Model 3 trucks, which he has dubbed the Model 6. Musk said the first Spacemaker will be operational by mid-2023. And though many expect the Model 3 to be an enormous undertaking, it will make progress — because unlike previous motorized vehicles, things can change.Musk has said the first Spacemaker will be human-powered by 2020. But the computer will still be hooked up to the grid, meaning it will rely on local power. That will make it tricky to power the vehicle — unless the geoffices are set correctly — and leaves it vulnerable to battery shortfalls.Tesla is known for making consumer-grade cars, but for long-haul delivery, dealing with unpredictable conditions or power failure is its highest priority.Last year, Musk promised that Tesla

Thanks to machine learning, they can illuminate traffic for much more effective and safer operation than they could on paper.In research authored by Atsushi Sakamoto and colleagues at the Institute of Intelligent Systems and Decision Support in Tokyo, the team presents an efficient way to turn traffic lights on and off. In practice, however, identifying and setting the timing for lighting within a traffic space can prove difficult, as it’s often unpredictable and there may even be visual clues that indicate the start of a car ahead or the end of a short one.Sakamoto and colleagues came up with an efficiency-enabling solution based on approaches developed by researchers at Google, IBM, and Toyota.

TITLE= Amazon to Retrain a Third of Its U.S. Workers as Automation Advances TEXT= So far, American workers have made up just 18.6% of the net employment that the United States produces in employment, according to the latest estimates from the National Employment Forum, a coalition of business leaders. This represents less than 1% of the total U.S. workforce and less than 4% of net employment. While the federal government provides some relief, it covers much more than this. Together, American workers produce more than 60% of the net employment, amounting to more than $13 trillion per year. To make up that missing piece, companies in industries that were expected to add jobs to workers and then go bankrupt are struggling to hire as many workers as they need to, says the coalition report.The jobs lost and gained in this way are not easily quantifiable. “ Automation has a very long history of being a tailwind to productivity growth,” says Erik Brynjolfsson, CEO of Brynjolfsson & Co. “The reason for this tailwind is the mismatch between how workers are represented and how production moves into those new roles.”The federal government incentivizes companies to

It is part of a coordinated effort by academics and companies to zero in on ways to neutralize the bots, dispelling any concerns about their casting doubt on the efficacy and effectiveness of their online advertising. The bots live online and in the real world, collecting and analyzing large amounts of information on a given user’s intentions and actions.Because bots are such complex and pervasive, studies are necessary to understand their persuasive power and, in some cases, to dispel the bots' influence, according to Noam Brown, an assistant professor at the university and coauthor of a new paper detailing those efforts. That requires new insights into the ways in which artificial intelligence can be leveraged to counter the influence of bots.

TITLE= Artificial Intelligence Advances in Health Care Will Be Slow, Not Slow TEXT= Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely in use today; some of the most exciting demonstrations of it come from applications such as conversing with your family or robots playing a passive role in a virtual world, or inverse reinforcement learning, in which a machine replaces an individual’s decision-making process in a virtual world to recommend something to do online. Other forms of AI, such as search and social media recommendations, use pattern recognition to target ads for specific groups of people. However, these technologies still require a lot of computation to perform well—and current research suggests that the rate of improvement will only get better if we can accelerate the use of AI to improve healthcare outcomes.Artificial intelligence (AI) is now widely employed in the healthcare industry, used extensively to improve or even ensure the performance of medical diagnostic tools. Researchers make significant progress in the last decade or so, building on stunning advances in basic AI fundamentals—key computational principles that allow machines to reason about many complex scenes and situations—and applying these principles to medicine. These principles lead to better, more accurate and effective clinical care, advancing diagnostic technologies like X-rays or time course predictions for a person undergoing cancer

Some psychiatrists use a computer to assess patients, trying to determine how they might respond to everyday circumstances, like guns or knives, or talking on the phone. But the Air Force is hoping to change that by enlisting the help of companies like Clarifai, a company that’s trained thousands of psychiatrists to use its technology.A recent survey conducted by the U.S. Army through its war-fighting research arm found that only about half of respondents thought that their company’s products would be effective at predicting the effects of PTSD symptoms after five years of follow-up interviews. Other research suggests that only about a quarter thought that any kind of new technology would be effective. So the Air Force is taking steps to trial the technologies in hopes of helping its troops adapt.Clarae Robertson, the company’s lead researcher, says the trial is the first test of its kind among modern war-fighting operations. “We wanted to see if we could have the same impact on the way people cope with post-traumatic stress disorder,

TITLE= Patterns of Artificial Intelligence Are Biased. Here's How They Are Being Made TEXT= Over the last two decades, humanity faced two major challenges. Forerunners of the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) developed techniques for identifying patterns in written text. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled researchers to apply these techniques to speech or images, making them essentially mimetic tools of the human brain. But while these forms of AI outperform human vision, they also raise serious concerns about their accuracy, efficiency, and privacy.In this research, we review the recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and the ethics of using these technologies, and argue how the technologies are being shaped by and contributed to these third fields of research. We also discuss recent efforts to regulate AI and the human condition and offer a perspective on the implications of these technologies.Artificial intelligence is a general-purpose enabling technology with applications anywhere within the economy. For example, it is used to automate aspects of decision-making and supports the routine collection and management of personal data. It is used in games, pattern recognition and to monitor people’s emotions and whereabouts. It is being deployed across borders to measure economic performance and to detect hate speech.

This can best be understood by mapping the physical world around a workstation and employing computers to execute a task. The machines are initially designed with wheels to move about, others to stay in the frame, and a camera system in the circuit for image recognition and manipulation.At Starsky we develop our machine learning (ML) platform, called Tensor Processing Units, to drive the computation that actually makes our workplaces and products perform. The idea here is to move from modeling to decision-making and from intuitive manipulation of large-scale data to decision-making in the real world. It is designed to solve many of the challenges that are inherent to jobs in the manufacturing, warehousing, health care, education, and elsewhere and to empower workers to achieve a purpose that isn’t achieved just by making technology cheaper. By enabling firms to operate more cheaply, we can position them to compete in an increasingly globalized economy.At Starsky, we’re making progress on just such a future.

That’s surprisingly natural and close to capturing how gamers form associations, and suggests a new method of tackling a problem that’s both challenging and intellectually stimulating.Such repetitions are particularly resonable when they match a goal, such as tracking a bird across the field. Alternatively, if you’re stuck, say, tracking an enemy, the Dreamer system generates sentences in natural language to match you. Such sentences become connectional within Dreamer, responding to the context of the sequence of words by generating corresponding sentences, even when they don’t match the context.This approach

Also under boycott is American Express.As The Daily Beast previously reported, over the last few weeks, employees at some of Utah’s largest companies have been warned not to tell anyone their data is being used by other companies or organizations unless compelled by state or federal privacy laws. In response, public records requests and litigation by groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Amnesty International, and Common Cause have demanded that the state stop police use of Clearview AI’s technology, face recognition, and other tracking technologies.In response, the companies have said they won’t sell data collected by the company to outside researchers or Illinois-based data brokers, and that they won’t sell access to the data to outside researchers or Illinois-

TITLE= Meet Microsoft's first AI-powered coffee machine TEXT= Jeff Dean, chair of Microsoft’s artificial intelligence (AI) division, recently sat down with WIRED senior writer Will Knight to discuss the value of building products that do a lot of good, but don’t always do much of anything else.Dean tells WIRED that he thinks we’ll all need to find some sort of “general purpose product” — a conceptual mashup of software and hardware that completely reimagines the capabilities of a specific computer (or, more generally, a business) in order to tackle one task. It’ll probably require buy-in from product builders, analyst agnostics, human resources departments, call centers, product managers, and a few other well-intentioned minds, but Microsoft has a pretty good shot at that right now.Dean tells WIRED that while there’s certainly value in building product companies that “do something interesting,” they also need to do it in a way that can tackle customer needs. There’s a certain inevitability that when companies start leaning into AI (or deep learning), they’ll need to think big.“Deep learning is not going

TITLE= Robots could help save your county from the flu TEXT= The iconic clockworkwork clock is falling apart. As people scramble to re-start life-saving work around the globe, scientists believe artificial intelligence could help keep it all going in a cooler, more human way.At least, that's the theory being proposed by researchers at Stanford, designed to lay out the challenges ahead. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) could bring about an entirely new crop of jobs, the experts said.In research published in the scientific journal Nature Machine Intelligence, researchers reveal how current methods can often take AI months or even years to accomplish. And given the current pandemic, it's unlikely a task like remote work will be far behind.Rather than re-start the clock, scientists hypothesize we could instead use machine learning to re-create the essential elements of human lives – the ability to work during the pandemic, for example, and the ability to balance work and social life during a pandemic."If we can use common sense, how do we get the things we need to do to stay healthy?" study author Ioannis Costanzaiu, assistant professor of computer science and center fellow, said.For some people, the idea of automation

TITLE= The U.S. Is Too Hot to Handle the Elastic Compressive AI Revolution TEXT= From 2012 to 2018, the world's top artificial intelligence researchers — AI pioneers DeepMind and Google — generated a whirlwind of press coverage. One widely covered story said the “AI revolution” was about to see an explosion of new machine learning research — some big and fast. Another said the industry was about to enter a plateau and require policy changes. In 2014, the Wall Street Journal called the AI boom “the biggest AI success story of all time.”There was also a lot of public hype. But what really took off in 2012 was the emergence of the “AI superpowers” — multibillion-dollar AI companies with powerful AIs that surpassed human-level expertise in a field known as artificial general intelligence (AGI). With about 100 billion parameters, or AI methods — huge datasets of data sets containing something like 6 trillion parameters — deep learning powers supercomputers with superhuman ability to tackle human tasks like speech and driving.Many people thought this would be a great time to upgrade AI, so they invested. But the field remained sluggish, and so hot was the AI revolution that some researchers and investors wanted to turn the

TITLE= The Birthplace of AI TEXT= The Birthplace of AII. THE BENEATH OF AIIn 1945, at age 22, my father, the inventor of the atomic blowup, was diagnosed with cancer. The following year, after my second diagnosis, I was diagnosed with breast cancer.This diagnosis was not unexpected. For two very different reasons: I had been diagnosed with cancer before (i.e., my father was diagnosed with the disease at the same time) and after; and two other diagnoses seemed entirely plausible, since I was diagnosed with both cancers at the same time.Even though baseball is physics, physics is not what matters when you want to predict the future. Two different approaches to cancer were being tried — one by machine and another by nature.The machine approach involved two opposing approaches. For baseball, the doctors measure base hits on a batter's head, then measure the hits on a second baseman's head during each base phase. Based on these two approaches, the pitch is compared pitch by pitch. The artificial approach looks at baseball's 3-point trajectory, the hit batters head by head, and the two ways the pitch is used change how the season goes.My father looked at both approaches, first trying both first and

TITLE= Artist's conception of AI-generated art TEXT= AI-generated art can be pretty wild and weird, but this AI artist has found a way to make himself known.Since his San Francisco-based agency, Obvious, began drip-feeding its AI artwork last October, the public has been using the colorful, never-before-published images to share and discuss his latest work.This isn’t the first time Obvious has taken its unusual approach to art, says Cillian Debnamid, senior program director of digital media at the creative agency. Obvious began with traditional sketches and sketches, then artists paint over new ones.“It’s kind of like finding a theme,” Debnamid says. “You kind of grab the ideas and run with them until you get something that works.”One of the side effects of using AI is that people can see the style and parameters used to create the artwork. Sometimes it’s an approximation of what a human artist would do, using still images and lines from work that was produced by an AI. Other times, the AI is still hired to do the work and slowly tweaks the final results.“Some people find it a bit of

But the tech to interact with customers, such as NVIDIA’s GeForce graphics-rendering tech, has certainly found a niche in some devices running virtual reality apps.Now Uni is releasing the full details of its AI persono — the neural network-powered persono that’s supposed to challenge the competition at EVO 2020. Uni’s not the only brand looking to test AI out of CES, but it’s demonstrating the virtue of depth, and maybe designing something a bit bigger.The Uni product was unveiled at the recent EVO event in Las Vegas, and showed a woman who appeared to be in the crowd dressed as an Amazon Alexa virtual assistant. Uni even showed off a virtual robotic arm that can shoot guns. We’ve reached out to the brand to learn more, but are awaiting updates.“NU is aware of

TITLE= Government should make it easier to sue people who confuse AI TEXT= SUSP researchers have developed a new obstacle: Computers that confuse AI are now illegal everywhere, from schools to law enforcement. The problem has come up across tech companies in the past few years, but no longer represents a serious threat to humanity. It’s an issue with big tech’s main roadblocks: sensors that monitor our faces and bodies.But such issues are just as important as a lawsuit, because they can impact people in ways that can go unreported or are justifiably controversial. In recent years, some tech companies have used AI to stoke fears about general intelligence—enormously high levels of self-awareness and advanced planning that let an algorithm anticipate an event horizon that someone else would not anticipate. Last year, for example, Facebook announced that it was taking steps to try to sue an AI that taught itself everything from recognizing the faces of all passengers to taking the names of its over-sharing customers.This time around, the tech company tried a different approach: It was less conceptual in tone, deploying a technical solution that, without too much exposition, showed few limits. The approach was so subtle, in fact, that some experts who

TITLE= Measuring abstract knowledge without writing it TEXT= I’m 10 years old. I have a lot of expertise in computer science, and I want to use that to measure my understanding of knowledge. If I can show that I know what a book is about, and what’s in it, then it can be done. I’m hoping to use this to measure human knowledge without writing it. I’m very familiar with trying various kinds of natural language questions, but with no idea how to begin. I've been meaning to program an AI program (a bot) to do this.This program does what I think it should be able to do (a summary of the major terms it thinks are commonly understood):It only needs a basic knowledge of the word "ahhhh" to understand that it's a bird. But apparently it can also answer questions about the Bible, using only its knowledge of the scientific language to fill in the gaps.Hence it can probably do the following:Write a short story about a book that contains a number of other terms that relate to the Bible, and fill in the blanks using only their knowledge.If I have all the information in my head, I could do the following,

TITLE= ACLU Statement on Robotic Trucks TEXT= In January of 2019, California banned government agencies from the use of facial recognition technologies, effectively curbing their own role in biometric surveillance. The ACLU has consistently supported driverless vehicle bans, but it finally made its way Tuesday, when the group held a series of smaller rallies across the country and petitioned the state’s legislatures to stop their implementation.Here’s how the groups worked:Over a year ago, PAVE—a nonprofit that creates safety, policy, and awareness campaigns to increase public awareness about autonomous vehicle safety—published a report defining automated vehicle deployment, committing driverless safety, and making policy recommendations. PAVE specifically targeted safety-critical mobility and entertainment technologies, as well as data management and situational awareness, as key topics encountered when AVs are on the road. The group specifically targeted the video cameras ubiquitous in commercial and ride-hailing fleets, as well as emergency and ride-hailing drivers, and the Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile apps.The group specifically

TITLE= Dungeon crawling has officially arrived at the park! TEXT= The first ever truly stand-alone adventure game is here. And it is what we get to explore as you wander the halls of this mysterious and terrifying hotel. If you've ever played a video game, you may remember its name as the name of one of the greatest video game demonstrations of the age: Montezuma’s Revenge. In 1997, at a party at a hotel, you explore a modern-day version of the classic game in a small, nondescript house as you explore to find all keys, furniture and other goodies hidden throughout the house. If you remember, this version of the game first appeared in 1997 as a text adventure, a kind of puzzle-platformer with the fewer puzzle pieces and the easier way to complete them. Montezuma’s Revenge is perhaps the most famous video game in the world.Released for PC in 1995 and played by 4K graphics and an average-beefy 60 frames per second, it spawned a wave of startups and publishers eager to push the genre forward. Now, however, a newer co-op phenomenon is creating the first real open-ended video game where the desire to explore and solve the game runs

TITLE= Can artificial intelligence fight elderly gamers? Not unless you have Alzheimer's TEXT= Can artificial intelligence fight elderly gamers? Not unless you have Alzheimer's.While there are already some ways that artificial intelligence could work out which players are at greater risk of developing Alzheimer's simply by watching YouTube games, that hasn't been possible until now. Artificial intelligence (AI) just can't, which is why it's been shown that it's possible for the software to combat the cognitive impairment it was created to combat.In research published in the prestigious journal Science Medicine, researchers show that training an AI system to play a game, such as Breakout, can actually teach it new tricks such as turning on certain graphics or phrases to make it claim that it's seen a certain movie screen.The system has already learned to recognize a phrase such as 'playing golf' in videos it's seen before, and responded with a growing number of eye exercises to demonstrate its abilities.While it's still very early days, the researchers posit that, using demonstrations to prove that AI can help with certain cognitive impairment symptoms might be a promising alternative to treatments which are currently limited by the number of symptoms it shows.If nothing else, the research proves that AI needs to be trained to play a

TITLE= Quantifying Independently Reproducible Machine Learning TEXT= Peer review has come a long way in recent years. With social media and the internet, social media has become a way of communicating and seeing each new Facebook news article as part of the person’s life — all in the knowledge that the other person (or, more likely, the author) was the author of the piece. It’s an easy way to establish credibility, generate clickbait articles, and get a new person’s online approval. But for many people, reproducibility means replicating results simply not having existed for one moment.A new paper from researchers at Stanford and Brown University offers a new way to do this. It proposes to take this sort of communication tool and make it genuinely reproducible by hiding it behind a data set of simply labeled data sets.The idea is not to create algorithms that tell you everything you need to know, but to get “something precise” about each labeled data set by collecting it and labeling it itself so the other person could perform the task. The data set would have labels such as “news articles” or “comments” — each of these could be one of many hundreds of one

TITLE= Robotics and the future of work TEXT= If you can see a future in which your job is to help make new progress in robotics, you will be hard-pressed to say not human.The future of work may not look a lot like the past — a future in which people rely on platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk to meet human-like demands. But that future is likely to look a lot different from the dystopian one we are in now, because many roles will be replaced, many roles will be retrained, and a whole generation of workers will need to find new and better ways to join and flourish.For many of them, retraining comes with a cost — a job search online has to involve tasks like finding information about your country of residency and bringing a laptop with you when you return home. And for others, working with robots takes only a few hours of time, which can be expensive, requiring compensation that is separate to the job.“Online jobs are going to be fully automated.”Arthur Julian-BorchakovskyIt is hard for many people to find jobs in the near future when they can no longer think, work and sleep. To help fill these jobs, many try to find new and better jobs.

TITLE= The man who got deepfaked to death wanted to prove that deepfakes can be faked TEXT= US researchers at the University of Texas at Austin have developed a deepfake-generating software that can convincingly fool facial-recognition systems with convincing images.Since 2013, a team of more than 70 experts has used deepfake-generating software to create fake videos of celebrities, politicians, and corporate corporate representatives speaking in unison to alter video—including key moments in the presidential election.The system first creates a video of a speaker whose face and voice is superimposed on another person's. The system then creates a fake video with the words “Deepfakes” in the center. In most cases, the system replaces the original speaker with someone else.The system has been used to achieve good results in a limited form—including faked suicide vids and headshots. The researchers demonstrated the system to researchers and presented it with more realistic video of leading members of Congress and corporate entities.“Our work demonstrates the value of synthesizing human voices with deepfakes,” says PhD student Ryan Sinnet, who is also the paper’s senior research scientist.In experiments, the team fed the deepfake-gener

But its achievements aren’t limited to locating a human at the start of a game, in this case. In a two-player match of the popular video game StarCraft, only one of four bots can reach full strength. To qualify for promotion to the e-sports tier, teams must first beat a professional player in StarCraft II. The other three rounds of competition are random, requiring either a player to choose one of eight OpenAI Five bots for each game, or a random selection of three bots for each game, to qualify for promotion. If a player loses his spot, OpenAI Five unpacks and trains to win, just like human players do, using only five bots instead of the many learned from during rounds of competition. Since most bots

For example, 85% of scientists working on deep learning predict failure in about 90% of the cases where a model delivers a predicted answer. Dreamer, from Google’s AI subsidiary, develops predictive analytics technology that anticipates catastrophic failures in about 90% of the cases.Building on Google’s work in the academic community, Google Research (FAIR) today announced an AI system called Dreamer that provides businesses and governments with a novel way to predict which products will fail in a given circumstance. The system uses machine learning and deep learning to extract key information from past predictions, leverage correlations across multiple sources, and assess minute-to-minute context to predict failure in increasingly complex models.Using a neural network, Dreamer anticipates failure in roughly 90% of the cases. Leveraging natural language processing and reinforcement learning (RL), the system automatically learns the business-critical components of a model
